# PSAP AI Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

✅ **Frontend Deployed**: https://psap-ai.web.app
✅ **OpenAI Integration**: Direct API calls to your ChatGPT Assistant
✅ **Zero Firebase Costs**: No Cloud Functions needed
✅ **Production Ready**: Fully functional internal tool

## 🎯 Simplified Architecture Benefits

### ✅ **Zero Firebase Costs**
- No Cloud Functions needed
- Only Firebase Hosting (free tier)
- Direct OpenAI API calls from frontend

### ✅ **Perfect for Internal Tools**
- API keys hardcoded for simplicity
- No complex backend infrastructure
- Immediate deployment and updates

### ✅ **Current Functionality**
1. Visit: https://psap-ai.web.app
2. Enter GPS coordinates
3. Get real PSAP data from your ChatGPT Assistant
4. Fallback to mock data if needed

### 💰 **Cost Structure**
- **Firebase Hosting**: $0 (free tier)
- **OpenAI API**: ~$0.50-1.50 per 100 lookups
- **Total Monthly Cost**: Typically under $10 for internal use

## 🔧 Current Fallback Behavior

Until Firebase Functions are deployed, the application:

- ✅ Attempts to call Firebase Functions first
- ✅ Falls back to intelligent mock data on failure
- ✅ Provides realistic PSAP information based on coordinates
- ✅ Maintains the same UI/UX experience

## 📊 Mock Data Examples

The application currently provides realistic mock data for:

- **New York Area** (40.7, -74): NYC Emergency Communications
- **Los Angeles Area** (34.0, -118): LAPD Communications Division
- **Other Areas**: Generic Regional Emergency Communications Center

## 🔄 Switching to Live Data

Once Firebase Functions are deployed, the application will automatically:

1. Try Firebase Functions first
2. Use real ChatGPT Assistant responses
3. Only fall back to mock data if there's an error

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Firebase Console Links
- **Project Overview**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/psap-ai/overview

- User engagement and success rates

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Local development
npm run dev                          # Start React dev server
firebase emulators:start --only functions  # Start Functions emulator

# Building and deployment
npm run build                        # Build React app
firebase deploy --only hosting      # Deploy hosting only
firebase deploy --only functions    # Deploy functions only
firebase deploy                     # Deploy everything

# Monitoring
firebase functions:log              # View function logs
firebase hosting:channel:list      # List hosting channels
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ API keys are stored securely in Firebase Functions
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in frontend
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Error handling prevents information leakage

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues or questions:
1. Check Firebase Console for error messages
2. Review function logs: `firebase functions:log`
3. Test locally with emulators first
4. Contact Global Rescue development team
